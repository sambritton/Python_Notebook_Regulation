# Python Notebook Regulation
Learns regulation using metabolic control theory (MCA) and reinforcement learning (RL). 
Steady state optimization is performed using the Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm. Regulation is performed on several pathways with respective .dat files denoting metabolic reactions. Jupyter notebooks load pathways, set metabolite concentrations, as well as perform regulation in each MCA method. RL example code is provided.

- Gluconeogenesis
- Glycolysis-TCA
- Glycolysis-TCA & Pentose Phosphate


# Plots

Pathway regulation prediction data is provided as well as pathway visualization notebooks. 

# Requirements

- python3
- numpy
- equilibrator
- pytorch
